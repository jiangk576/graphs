# Graph networks
## Introduction
This repository holds some active research on the field of Graph networks and how Graph networks could be used in Finance,  Financial Services, Tax or Accounting for everyday use cases.

### Graph networks
The background to current Graph database technology is in [Graph Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory). Graph Theory sets out the discussion based on nodes connected by edges. A 'node' is some sort of entity.  A person, place, or thing.  An edge is an expressed relationship between nodes.  Consider your membership of a social media site.  In that context you are a 'node' and your 'friendship' with others is expressed as an edge.  You are member x and you are friends with member y.  Member x and y are connected via an edge.  The tag on that edge is 'became friends on z date'.

### Types of Graphs
There is a substantial amount of written literature on the topic.  One nice source is Easley and Kleinberg, 2010 and they discuss types of graphs as follows.

**Collaboration Graphs**. Here we are interested in who works for whom,  who wrote papers with others,  or actors or co-actors in movies, plays. For Finance use could this type of Graph be used to visualize the legal entity structure, share capital, ownership of entities. This is one aspect of our research.



Who-talks-to-Whom Graphs.
Information Linkage Graphs.
Technological Networks
Networks  in  the  Natural  World.
