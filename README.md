# Graph networks
## Introduction
This repository holds some active research on the field of Graph networks and how Graph networks could be used in Finance,  Financial Services, Tax or Accounting for everyday use cases.

### Graph networks
The background to current Graph database technology is in [Graph Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory). Graph Theory sets out the discussion based on nodes connected by edges. A 'node' is some sort of entity.  A person, place, or thing.  An edge is an expressed relationship between nodes.  Consider your membership of a social media site.  In that context you are a 'node' and your 'friendship' with others is expressed as an edge.  You are member x and you are friends with member y.  Member x and y are connected via an edge.  The tag on that edge is 'became friends on z date'.

### Types of Graphs
There is a substantial amount of written literature on the topic.  One nice source is Easley and Kleinberg, 2010 and they discuss types of graphs as follows.

**Collaboration Graphs**. Here we are interested in who works for whom,  who wrote papers with others,  or actors or co-actors in movies, plays. For Finance use could this type of Graph be used to visualize the legal entity structure, share capital, ownership of entities. This is one aspect of our research.

**Who-talks-to-Whom Graphs** Collecting emails, public posts, discussion forums can help to create a graph of who comments on what posts. Who likes posts. Our interest in this type of network is the who-trades-with-who scenario or who buys from who.

**Information Linkage Graphs** Easley and Kleinberg, 2010 provide an example of such a network as being the 'Web' or Internet. Where pages are nodes and links between pages are directed edges. Our interest in these graphs is based on algorithm trading. Could a graph structure help to trace events leading to large increases or decreases in key stocks on an exchange such as New York and thereby add a rich otherwise unknown signal for the markets.

**Technological Networks** The design of networks, physical infrastructure, firewalls and routing through the physical internet is almost always presented in graph format. Technological networks is a key concern in Finance but more so at the CIO and IT provisioning level. Finance generally consume these services with Service Level agreements.

**Networks  in  the  Natural  World** Finally there are many examples in the Natural world of networks that can be represented as graphs. The human brain and current deep learning neural networks in perhaps our favorite. As a child you perhaps studied the food chain. Which animal eats which other with 'man' at the top of the food chain. Another example could be the humble family tree. Deep learning neutral networks are a fashion now and have use cases in Finance. 

### Repository
This repository holds our code, examples, notebooks, data files produced and is a work in progress.  You are welcome to get involved. Send us your thoughts, ideas. You can find us on our [blog](www.mlexperience.org). Conclusions may not emerge for some time given the depth of the field and complexity involved. Tune in frequently.
